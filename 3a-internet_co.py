# Part 1
# 
# An Internet service provider offers three subscription packages to its customers, 
# plus a discount for nonprofit organizations:
#  
# Package A: 10 hours of access for $12.95 per month. Additional hours are $4.00 per hour.
# Package B: 20 hours of access for $14.95 per month. Additional hours are $2.00 per hour.
# Package C: Unlimited access for $35.95 per month.
# 
# A nonprofit organizations will get 20# discount on all packages.
# 
# Create a Python program that asks user to enter the following information:
#     The Package customer selects
#     The hours used
#     Is the customer a non-profit organization
# And compute the monthly charge accordingly.
#
# Input validation: The number of hours used in a month cannot exceed 744.�
# 
# Test your program with these data:
# a. Package A using 10 hours and is non-profit.
# b. Package B using 25 hours, not non-profit: cost: $24.95
# c. Package C using 800 hours, is non-profit: cost: input error
# 
# Enter package (A, B, C): a
# Enter hours used: 10
# Are you a non-profit organization?(y/n): y
# The service charge is: $10.36
# >>> 
# 
# Enter package (A, B, C): b
# Enter hours used: 25
# Are you a non-profit organization?(y/n): n
# The service charge is: $24.95
# >>> 
# 
# Enter package (A, B, C): c
# Enter hours used: 800
# Are you a non-profit organization?(y/n): y
# Hours cannot exceed 744!
# Note: Considering the possibility that user may enter the package with uppercase or lowercase letter, you may use string�s upper() or lower() to convert the package to the case you want in order to determine the package correctly in your program.

# Part 2
# An electric company charges customers based on Kilowatt-Hours (Kwh) used.� The rules to compute the charge are:
# 
# First 50 Kwh
# 35 cents per Kwh
# 
# Each of the next 100 Kwh (up to 150 Kwh), the first 50 Kwh used is still charged at 35 cents each
# 45 cents per Kwh
# 
# Each of the next 300 Kwh (up to 450 Kwh)
# 
# Kwhs used between 50 and 150 are charged at 45 cents each
# 65 cents per Kwh
# 
# All Kwh over 450,
# 
# Kwhs used between 150 and 450 are charged at 65 cents each
# 80 cents per KH
# 
# Create a Python program that asks a user to enter Kwh used, and compute the electricity charges.� The Kwh used could be a number with decimals.�
# 
# Requirements:
#     Input validation: Kilowatt-Hours cannot exceed 2000.�
#     Test your program with (1) Kwh=4500, (2) Kwh = 400
# 
# Turn in the program's screenshot and the code.
#
# ********* Sample run *********:
# 
# Enter Kilowatt-Hours used: 400
# Kilowatt-Hours used: 400.0 , charge is: $225.00
# 
# >>> 
# Enter Kilowatt-Hours used: 4500
# The Kilowatt-Hours used cannot be more than 2000!
# >>>

# Copy the source code and paste to a Word document, and copy the output and paste it to the same Word document. Submit the Word document by email attachment.
